# LM Reflection + Step-Local Credit Assignment

This repo investigates whether **step-local credit assignment** (predicting where reasoning fails) can outperform **outcome-gated reflection** (RRR-style) on math reasoning with curriculum learning.

## Methods
- **Baseline RLVR-CoT**: outcome reward on final answer
- **RRR (Outcome-gated reflection + retry)**: reward reflection tokens only when retry succeeds
- **Step-local credit assignment**: learn/predict mistake step index and weight policy gradients by step region

## Repo layout
- `src/rrr/` — reflection + retry training and prompting
- `src/step_credit/` — mistake-step labeler + locator + weighted RL
- `src/eval/` — first-try and retry evaluation
- `configs/` — experiment configs
- `scripts/` — entrypoints for training/eval
- `notebooks/` — plotting and analysis

## Quickstart
1. Create venv and install deps
2. Prepare data
3. Run baseline, RRR, and step-credit experiments
4. Generate plots

## Results
All runs logged to `results/` (ignored by git). Use `notebooks/` to plot.
